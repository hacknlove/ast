# Agora Speakers Timer

This application is intended to make the Timer role easiest.

## How to use

### Automatic

If you want the application to change the colors automatically:

1. open: https://hacknlove.github.io/ast/
2. Write the amount of "green" minutes
3. press the `intro` or `enter` key
4. Turn your laptop or tablet, so the speaker can see the screen.
5. When the speaker ends his speech, press `e` *(or press the mouse primary button, or touch anywhere on the screen)* to **E**nd and to go to the first screen.
6. 30 seconds after "red" an applause sound will start playing, join the applause.
7. You can press `s` *(or etc.)* to **E**nd and go to the first screen

Pressing any key will end automatic mode.
